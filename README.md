# Quora Question Paris Duplicate

This project focuses on solving the Quora question duplicate task using Deep Learning Neural Network LSTM and Siamese architecture with Google News word embeddings. The goal is to determine whether two given questions on Quora are duplicates or not.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following:

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* Google News word embeddings (pre-trained vectors)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sid41x4/DL_HW_Quora_Question_Duplicate.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
